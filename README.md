# Dielectric_prediction

This repository contains the pre/post processing python code, forcefield files and LAMMPS input files for our dielectric constant prediction simulations.
The goal is to automate and speed up the process of predicting the dielectric constance of novel oxides. To test our receipe we used silicon-zirconium oxide with various percentages of zirconium.
